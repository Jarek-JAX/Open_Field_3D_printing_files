# Open_Field_3D_printing_files
All files are in .STL format, exported with tolerance of .005" (Inch)
see "List_stl_files_for_3D_printing.pdf" for details
01/24/2023, Added 2 files (Light_bkt_3Dmodel_metric.stp) & (Light_bkt_3Dmodel_metric.stl)
those files are alternate design to Derlin light bracket so they can be 3D printed (need 350mm bed) or modiyfied if needed
